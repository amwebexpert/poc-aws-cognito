# poc-aws-cognito

POC with React app connecting to AWS Cognito through amplify-js library

## Note How to run in HTTPS mode

- Create a Self Signed certificate
``` bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout keytmp.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
openssl rsa -in keytmp.pem -out key.pem

```

- In your package.json, modify start command
``` json
"scripts": {
    "start": "export HTTPS=true&&SSL_CRT_FILE=cert.pem&&SSL_KEY_FILE=key.pem react-scripts start"
  },
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
